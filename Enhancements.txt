Ideas
- Continue to improve error handling 
- Batch API calls together to reduce the number of HTTP connections your client has to make
- Add pagination to receive only a subset of data to reduce the size of request. Pagination is handled using the nextPageToken parameter. 
- Make parallel request 
- Rate limiting logic based on Google Service limitation and add delays between requests
- Add caching to improve performance 
- Add asyncio concurrent: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

Security 
- API rate limit 
- Automate token refresh : implement automatic token refreshing; use Oauth2.0 refresh token implementation
- Role based access controls : based on needs for the script

Test
- Cover more edge cases for unit testing (ex: Empty folder, permission issues, etc)
